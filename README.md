# CivilizationClicker
Simple Java clicker game based on the mechanics of Sid Meier's Civilization

Created in May 2014 in about two days as a final project for my high school CS course. Someday I may go back and add some new functionality and graphics. 

## TODO
* Rework graphics (use JavaFX?)
* Give indication of enemy troop strength
* Add victory condition
