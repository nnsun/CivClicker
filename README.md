# CivilizationClicker
Simple Java clicker game based on the mechanics of Sid Meier's Civilization

Created in May 2014 in two days as a final project for my high school CS course. 

## How to play
Your objective is to build a civilization that can defeat an empire in battle. To do this, you must gather resources. There are a total of five different resources: production, gold, food, science, and culture. Three of these resources are used to build buildings and troops for your army. The buildings help automate resource collection, e.g. the library automatically generates science. In order to be able to create buildings, though, you must unlock the science requirement. This involves collecting enough science and then researching the prerequisite technologies needed. To build a library, the writing technology must first be researched. If you build too many buildings, you will run out of land. To increase your total land, either increase your culture or win battles. 

## TODO
* Rework graphics (use JavaFX?)
* Add victory condition
